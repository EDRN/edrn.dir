# Back up our directory branches
# 
# This creates two timestamped files with backups of the EDRN and MCL
# directory branches in the EDRN directory service (which servies more
# than just EDRN, as you can see).
#
# The manager distinguished name for the directory is assumed to be
# ``uid=admin,ou=system``.  The password is passed as an environment variable
# $EDRN_LDAP_MANAGER_PASSWORD. You can preferentially create a
# ``~/.secrets/passwords.sh`` file and set a shell variable named
# edrn_ldap_manager_password there to set a password. Otherwise the password
# defaults to ``secret`` ðŸ˜‰
#
# Note this still isn't totally secure since we have to pass the password on
# the command line to ``ldapsearch`` (and its ``-W`` option doesn't read from
# ``stdin`` but from ``/dev/tty``)

# Do It
# -----
#
# Grab the two branches we're after.
#
#
# EDRN
# ~~~~
#
# First, EDRN. The query string grabs everything except the context entry
# dc=edrn,dc=jpl,dc=nasa,dc=gov. EDRN stands for Early Detection Research
# Network, by the way ðŸ˜‰

ldapsearch \

    -b "dc=edrn,dc=jpl,dc=nasa,dc=gov" \
    '(&(objectClass=*)(!(dc=edrn)))' '*' '+' > "edrn-$date.ldif"


# MCL
# ~~~
#
# Next, MCL. As above, we avoid the context entry. By the way, MCL is the
# horrible acronym for the horribly long "Consortium for Molecular and
# Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions" ðŸ¤¢
