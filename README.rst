****************************
 EDRN Directory (Utilities)
****************************

Here are some utilities for dealing with the EDRN Directory Service.


Notes
=====

The current one is at ``ldaps://edrn.jpl.nasa.gov`` but the new one will be at
``ldaps://edrn-ds.jpl.nasa.gov``


Features
========

The only feature right now is ``backup.sh``. It backs up to the current
directory, creating two files:

â€¢ ``edrn-DATE.ldif``, an LDIF file containing all the EDRN_ entries.
â€¢ ``mcl-DATE.ldif``, an LDIF file containing all the MCL_ entries.

The ``DATE`` is a ``YYYY-MM-DD`` timestamp for today.  You can load this into
a new LDAP server if you first clear out the existing EDRN and MCL entries
(leaving the empty context nodes ``dc=edrn,dc=jpl,dc=nasa,dc=gov`` and
``o=MCL`` entries).  LDAP command line utilties are woefully inadequate.
Let's hope you won't have to do this too often so we won't bother to audomate
it; just use ApacheDirectoryStudio_.

You can then add them back with::

    ldapadd -x -W -D uid=admin,ou=system -H ldaps://edrn-ds.jpl.nasa.gov -f edrn-DATE.ldif
    ldapadd -x -W -D uid=admin,ou=system -H ldaps://edrn-ds.jpl.nasa.gov -f mcl-DATE.ldif

Note that you might have to move parent nodes like ``ou=users,o=MCL`` to the
top of the files.
